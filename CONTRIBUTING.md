## How to Suggest Features or Improvements

We'd love to hear your ideas! Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/codesphere-ecosystem/managed-services-registry/issues/new) to discuss your proposed feature or improvement before submitting code. This allows us to align on the design and approach.

## Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3.  **Set Up Development Environment:**

    * Ensure you have Go installed. The minimum required Go version is specified in the `go.mod` file.
    * Clone your forked repository: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/managed-services-registry.git`
    * Navigate to the project directory: `cd managed-services-registry`
    * Run `make`: This formats, lints, tests, and builds the provider.

4.  **Follow Coding Standards:**

    * Format Go code with `make fmt`.
    * We use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for static code analysis. Please run it locally before submitting a pull request: `make lint`.
    * Keep Harbor API behavior in `internal/harbor` and the server entry point in `cmd/server`.
    * Update deployment or provider YAML when a change affects runtime configuration, required secrets, or the managed-service contract.

5.  **Write Tests:**

    * Add Go tests in `_test.go` files next to the code under test.
    * Prefer focused, table-driven tests for configuration, request mapping, and Harbor client behavior.
    * Avoid tests that depend on a live Harbor instance unless the test is explicitly documented as an integration test.

6.  **Build and Test:**

    * Run `make` before opening a pull request. It executes formatting, linting, tests, and the local build.
    * Use `make build-linux` when you need to verify the Linux artifact used by deployments.

7.  **Commit Your Changes:**

    * We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. Please format your commit messages according to the Conventional Commits specification. Examples:
        * `fix(api): Handle edge case in API client`
        * `feat(cli): Add new command for listing resources`
        * `docs: Update contributing guide with commit message conventions`
    * **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**

        In order to contribute to this project, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). This is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the right to submit the code you are contributing.

        ```text
        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, or solely by me; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it) is maintained indefinitely
            and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the
            open source license(s) involved.
        ```

        To indicate that you accept the DCO, you must add a `Signed-off-by` line to each of your commit messages. Here's an example:

        ```
        Fix: Handle edge case in API client

        This commit fixes a bug where the API client would crash when receiving
        an empty response.

        Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
        ```

        You can add this line to your commit message using the `-s` flag with the `git commit` command:

        ```bash
        git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
        ```

8.  **Submit a Pull Request:** [Open a new pull request](https://github.com/codesphere-ecosystem/managed-services-registry/compare) to the `main` branch of this repository. Please include a clear description of your changes, validation performed, deployment or configuration impact, and any related issues.
